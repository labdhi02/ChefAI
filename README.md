Architecture

ChefAI follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to maintain a clean separation of concerns and ensure scalability.

Model: Handles the data and business logic.

View: The UI components of the app.

ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View, managing state and logic.

Tech Stack

Flutter: Framework for building natively compiled applications.

Dart: Programming language for Flutter.

API Integration: To fetch recipe data.

State Management: Provider (or your chosen state management solution).

API Integration

ChefAI integrates with external APIs to fetch recipes and ingredient data. To configure your API key:

Get an API key from your chosen recipe API provider (e.g., Spoonacular).

Add the key to lib/constants.dart:

const String API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
